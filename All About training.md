It is a style/ way of pragramming.
Langruage
  has-->Building Blocks
      has--->One or More Paradigms
Types of Paradigm
  --> Interactive: How to solve ? (Procedural object Oriented)

  Contains Objects
    having-->"Role & Responsibility"
    that--> "Collaborate & Communicate"
                dialogue--> Vocabolary [Essential]

  some chain to tasks, one function can call other and so on....
  Example: F1.F2.F3.....
  
  We have to wirte the code such that it should be Unit Testable and Maintainable( Less- refactoring)
